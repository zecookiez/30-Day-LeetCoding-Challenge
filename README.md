# 30 Day LeetCoding Challenge
A repository of my solutions for the 30 Day LeetCoding Challenge. My personal goal for this challenge is to write concise, clean code that is as efficient as possible. These solutions are tested with Leetcode's grading system and are written in Python or C++.

Solution explanations will be written as comments in the code, and if there are any further optimizations I will attempt to point additional resources.
